# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Project

## Overview

This project is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) built on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing various technologies including Truffle, Ganache, web3, Solidity, React.js, HTML, and CSS. The DAO enables decentralized governance, decision-making, and resource allocation within a secure and transparent ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Ensure you have Node.js installed to run the project.
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/): Install Truffle, a development framework for Ethereum, globally using npm.
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache): Install Ganache, a local blockchain for Ethereum development.
- [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/): Learn about web3.js, a JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum.
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): Familiarize yourself with React.js for the front-end.
- HTML and CSS: Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS for UI design.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivam9060/DAO_Dapp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd DAO_Dapp
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure Truffle to use Ganache:

   Update the `truffle-config.js` file to point to your Ganache RPC server.

5. Compile and deploy the smart contracts:

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate
   ```

6. Start Ganache:

   Run Ganache to simulate a local blockchain.

7. Start the React application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

8. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the DAO application.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `contracts/`: Contains the Ethereum smart contract files.
- `src/`: Contains the React.js application code.
- `truffle-config.js`: Truffle configuration file for Ethereum development.
- `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts.
- `public/`: Contains the HTML template and static assets.
- `README.md`: The README file you are currently reading.

## Features

- Decentralized governance and decision-making.
- Secure and transparent resource allocation.
